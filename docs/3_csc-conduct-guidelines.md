## 3.2	GM Behavior

    - **3.3.1.1**&emsp;The first group includes player contract MMRs, the contract MMR formula, and related information, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may not be shared with anyone outside of it.

    - **3.3.1.2**&emsp;The second group includes transaction information for franchises, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may only be shared with the permission of the appropriate individual or individuals (which could be yourself).

- **3.3.2**&emsp;This expectation of keeping certain knowledge secret continues even after you no longer have direct access to it.
