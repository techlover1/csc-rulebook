# League Info

---

## 2.1 Discord

- **2.1.1**&emsp;The league will make use of Discord (https://discordapp.com/) as its primary platform for communication and organization. All official announcements will occur in the league’s Discord server.

- **2.1.2**&emsp;All communication is expected to occur through Discord, using either the league’s server, your franchise’s server, or direct messages.

- **2.1.3**&emsp;You do not have to be in the league to be in the Discord server.

- **2.1.4**&emsp;Any advertisement of any non-CSC related events must be cleared by Admins.

&emsp;

## 2.2 Broadcasting Rules

- **2.2.1**&emsp;Teams are allowed to stream or record games in any way they would like. CSC only asks that any streams involving league games be “safe for work”. Recording of games and the saving of game replays is not required. CSC reserves the right to broadcast your games on our official Twitch/YouTube channels and to be able to spectate for the purpose of (re)broadcasting any league games.

&emsp;

## 2.3 Joining CSC

- **2.3.1**&emsp;A signup form will be made available prior to the start of each season of CSC.

    - **2.3.1.1**&emsp;This form is for new players only. A separate Intent to Return form will be sent out to anyone already in the league as a Player, Free Agent, Permanent Free Agent, or General Manager.

- **2.3.2**&emsp;Players must disclose all their accounts used to play Counter Strike in the signup form, whether they are regularly used or not. Failure to do so may result in consequences, including potential removal of the player from the league.

- **2.3.3**&emsp;The player must use accounts registered with CSC for all CSC events. If you are not using the account you have indicated as your main account, you must submit this information to the staff at least 30 minutes in advance of a CSC match or event.

- **2.3.4**&emsp;If a player is usually unavailable at the regular match time, they should not sign up for the league as a player. While it is unreasonable to expect players to never miss a scheduled time, every player should ensure they are likely to be available for most of them before signing up. Be aware that most GMs expect players to be available in advance of 10 PM ET in order to warm-up with their teams. Players should make any absence in the schedule clear to your GM.

&emsp;

## 2.4 CS:GO Bans

- **2.4.1**&emsp;Players with banned accounts must disclose them to CSC during signups. Some banned accounts may cause the player to be ineligible to play.

- **2.4.2**&emsp;Players permanently banned by Valve, Faceit, or ESEA may be eligible to play in CSC if the account in question falls under these categories:

    - **2.4.2.1**&emsp;It is a CS:GO VAC banned account that was banned over two years ago.

    - **2.4.2.2**&emsp;It is a Faceit banned account that was successfully appealed (proof of the successful appeal is required).

    - **2.4.2.3**&emsp;It is a Faceit banned account that was banned as a result of a VAC ban from over two years ago.

    - **2.4.2.4**&emsp;The account is not banned for cheating or ban evasion (proof of this is required)

    - **2.4.2.5**&emsp;If a banned account is not reported, but would not warrant a ban from the league or a change in the players MMR, the player will be suspended for 2 regular season match days.

- **2.4.3**&emsp;If there is a wave of inaccurate bans (evidence of this must be verifiable somewhere) admins may, at their discretion, allow players to play despite bans.

- **2.4.4**&emsp;If the banned account does not fall under the above exceptions then that player is ineligible to play in CSC. If franchised, the offending player will also be forced onto IR (Inactive Reserve) until that ban is removed in order to allow the possibility for appeal (this does not count towards the amount of players a franchise can have on IR). Each off-season, offending players that have played on IR in this way may be either reinstated or banned from future play indefinitely based upon the status of any appeals through the party through which they are banned. Attempting to circumvent this may result in match bans. Repeat attempts may result in your removal from the league.

- **2.4.5**&emsp;After a banned player is placed on IR or removed from the league, league members may submit evidence of prior suspicious gameplay from CSC games where the offending player might have cheated. At the discretion of the admins, the results of those games may be void, and the team of the offending player will FF retroactively. Admins will publicly display the evidence along with their reasoning of any decisions within a week after evidence is formally submitted by a GM.

&emsp;

## 2.5 Alternate Accounts

- **2.5.1**&emsp;Players may declare alternate faceit and steam accounts in the signup form when joining the league, or by sending a message to an Admin at any time.

    - **2.5.1.1**&emsp;Alternate accounts are collected to ensure everyone is given a fair MMR value in the league.

- **2.5.2**&emsp;If a player is found to have an alternate account they did not declare that would impact their MMR value, they are subject to punishment at Admin discretion.

    - **2.5.2.1**&emsp;These punishments include, but are not limited to, match day or season long suspensions, depending on the found discrepancy in MMR.

&emsp;

## 2.6 League Roles

- **2.6.1**&emsp;A person who plays in the league is referred to in these rules as a player.

- **2.6.2**&emsp;The league is led by the 5 Admins of CSC, who primarily work with long-term decisions and projects.

    - **2.6.2.1**&emsp;An admin candidate must meet certain criteria in order to be an eligible candidate.
        - **2.5.2.1.1**&emsp;You must be backed by the Backer Pool. This group will consist of any willing GM, Committee Head, or former admin (which includes admins at the end of their term) who is not running. In order to be officially backed by the pool, you must gain a vote of at least 20% of the pool (rounded up) in order to be eligible to be an active candidate for admin election discussion. You are encouraged to pursue more than this as if a backer decides to run after backing you they are eliminated from the pool.
        - **2.5.2.1.2**&emsp;You must have participated in at least one season of CSC
        - **2.5.2.1.3**&emsp;You may not currently have more than 1 serious strike or 2 normal strikes
        - **2.5.2.1.4**&emsp;You must not have been removed (or resigned to avoid removal) as admin in the past three seasons

- **2.6.3**&emsp;The league’s day-to-day activities are directed by Admins.

- **2.6.4**&emsp;The structures of the league are operated by Staff. There are several different roles that fall under the heading of Staff.

- **2.6.5**&emsp;The teams of the league are led by General Managers (GMs). Each GM is in charge of a grouping of teams known as a franchise. Some GMs have additional roles. GMs can be players; however, special rules apply to these circumstances.

    - **2.6.5.1**&emsp;A GM or AGM may have any Staff job other than Transaction Manager, Admin.

        - **2.5.5.1.1**&emsp;A GM or AGM in Numbers Committee may not be involved in the manual MMR adjustments of players, but may still work on the technical or formula side. 

    - **2.6.5.2**&emsp;If a GM is a player, this rule supersedes the rules for players becoming Staff. The restrictions on which jobs may be taken still apply in addition to the restrictions in this rule.

- **2.6.6**&emsp;Captains are players who have been tasked by their GM to lead a team. There are no specific responsibilities or privileges associated with being a Captain, other than what their specific GM grants them. Captains are not permitted to see privileged information.

- **2.6.7**&emsp;Assistant GMs (AGMs) are players who are tasked with assisting their GM in various tasks. There is no requirement as to what tier they must be in.

    - **2.6.7.1**&emsp;AGMs can remain with a franchise if they are not playing the following season(s). Conditions: The AGM must have been involved in at least 1 season with CSC and the AGM cannot be on another franchise or a free agent.

    - **2.6.7.2**&emsp;AGMs may be staff, but no AGM may hold the Transaction Manager role, due to potential conflict of interests

&emsp;

## 2.7	Transactions (see Section 5 for relevant rules)

- **2.7.1**&emsp;A player under contract with a franchise may be cut and placed on waivers. A player on waivers may have their contract claimed by another franchise. Several different circumstances may lead to a player being on waivers.

- **2.7.2**&emsp;A trade is a type of transaction where two GMs make an exchange of players from one franchise to another. Other assets may also be traded, such as draft picks. All trades are subject to Admin review and approval.

- **2.7.3**&emsp;A pickup is a type of transaction where a GM signs a contract with a Free Agent or a player currently on waivers. The player is then a part of that GM’s franchise.

- **2.7.4**&emsp;A cut is a type of transaction where a GM ends a contract with a player before the expiration date of that contract. The player leaves the franchise and is placed on waivers; if they are not picked up while on waivers, they will become a Free Agent.

- **2.7.5**&emsp;Promotion and relegation refer to moving players between teams within a franchise.

- **2.7.6**&emsp;Roster Lock is the deadline for GMs to submit initial tier rosters to League Staff. This is the day before the first regular season match day starts following the draft, at a time set by the Admins.

- **2.7.7**&emsp;A game is a single game of Counter Strike, played between two teams. In CSC, all games are played using the default rules for a standard 5v5 CSGO match and any map permitted in competitive playlists.

- **2.7.8**&emsp;When both teams are ready to play, the match will begin.

&emsp;

## 2.8	Clarifications

- **2.8.1**&emsp;The rules here and elsewhere are ultimately defined and interpreted by the Admins of CSC. The Admins may fill in for any other role for decision-making as necessary.

- **2.8.2**&emsp;The phrase “Admins and Staff” or similar is frequently used. It should be noted that Admins are included in Staff (all Admins are Staff), but not the opposite (not all Staff are Admins). Admins and Staff is, therefore, slightly redundant (though it does indicate where decisions or actions are more likely to involve Admins versus just non-Admin Staff).

&emsp;

- **2.9.2**&emsp;A franchise is a group of teams led by a General Manager.
